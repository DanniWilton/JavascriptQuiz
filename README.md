On the first page (as seen above) the container displays the "Start Quiz" button and the "High Scores" button. At this present time, the "High Scores" button does not work, in time it will display high scores from local storage.
When the User clicks the "Start Quiz" button, a new page loads where the first question, with 4 multiple choice answers and a timer of 15 seconds start.
The 4 multiple choice answers are displayed on 4 buttons that turn yellow when the user hovers their cursor over them. When the user selects an answer, the next question loads.
If the user selects the incorrect answer, 10 seconds will be taken off the total of the time remaining for the quiz. 
The user does not know they have selected the correct answer unless they notice time is not taken off from the time left. 
The score is calculated by  the remaining time left. Once the alert is displayed the score is displayed.
